Connecting to the Cluster
=========================

Connecting from within the Kennedy
----------------------------------

The BRMC login nodes ("cluster1.bmrc.ox.ac.uk" and "cluster2.bmrc.ox.ac.uk") are directly accessible from the Kennedy network.

Connecting from outside the Kennedy
-----------------------------------

Connections from outside the Kennedy should be made via the university VPN. If connecting using an apple mac computer, the CISCO anyconnect client is needed for a stable connection. It can be obtained from `the Univerity's IT service <https://help.it.ox.ac.uk/vpn>`_.
