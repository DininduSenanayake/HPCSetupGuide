# Sansom lab HPC Setup Guide

This repository contains configuration files and documentation for the group's use of the University of Oxford's BMRC cluster. 

Researchers in other groups using the Kennedy's Data Science Platform can also follow this guide if they wish to run e.g. the [cellhub](https://cellhub.readthedocs.io/) or txseq pipelines.

Please note that this guide is not a replacement for the [official BMRC documentation](https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/for-staff/resources/bmrc/r-and-rstudio-on-the-bmrc-cluster).
